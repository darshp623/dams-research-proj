        "Answer": " To ensure that data processors and subprocessors adhere to privacy requirements, Spotify uses a combination of legal mechanisms such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) and Adequacy Decisions. These mechanisms help to give your data the same level of protection as it has in the EU. For example, SCCs require the other party to protect your data and to provide you with EU-level rights and protections. Additionally, Spotify uses technical protections such as encryption and pseudonymization policies and processes to challenge disproportionate or unlawful government authority requests. It is also the responsibility of the user to only allow individuals to use their account where they're comfortable sharing this personal data with them. "
