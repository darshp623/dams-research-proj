This is often done for privacy and security reasons, as well as to reduce legal and financial risks associated with holding onto data for too long.\n\nIt's important to note that there are many laws and regulations around the world that govern how companies must handle personal data, including how long they can retain it. For example, in the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires companies to \"only keep the data for as long as necessary\" and to delete or anonymize any data that is no longer needed.\n\nIn general, it's a good practice for companies to have clear policies and procedures for how they handle personal data, including how long they retain it.
