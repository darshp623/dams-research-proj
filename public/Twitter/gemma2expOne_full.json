It mentions relying on \"standard contractual clauses\" and requiring third parties to maintain similar data protections as Twitter to mitigate risks associated with data sharing. This attempts to ensure responsible handling even when data is shared with external entities.\n* **User Control:** While not directly addressing conflicts of interest, the policy emphasizes user control over privacy settings and choices regarding interest-based advertising (through the DAA's consumer choice tool). This empowers users to some extent in shaping how their data is used, potentially mitigating potential conflicts by aligning practices with user preferences.\n\n**In summary:** The Twitter Privacy Policy doesn't offer a comprehensive conflict of interest management framework. It relies more on legal compliance, contractual safeguards for data transfers, and limited user control as mechanisms to address potential issues.\n\n\nIt's important to note that privacy policies are complex and evolving.
