        "Answer": "According to Section **Data Handling** of the Privacy Policy document, \"Twitter collects and uses data based on specific legal bases (available in more detail)\". There is no direct mention of the company's stance on government requests for user data. However, I can refer you to the section that mentions measures taken to protect data rights, such as \"using measures like standard contractual clauses\" which implies a level of protection against potential government requests."
