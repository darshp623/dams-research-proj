However, the policy mentions that users can opt out of interest-based advertising through the Digital Advertising Alliance Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (referenced in point 2), which may include resources for managing privacy settings. For detailed information on managing privacy settings and understanding data rights, I recommend checking Twitter's official website or contacting their support team via the methods provided in the Privacy Policy Inquiries page or through the Data Protection Inquiry Form mentioned in points 6 and 7."
