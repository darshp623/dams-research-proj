This suggests that Uber prioritizes user consent in handling their data.\n\nIf I had to make an educated guess, I'd say that the lack of mention on conflicts of interest is because Uber's approach focuses more on giving users control over their own data rather than explicitly addressing potential conflicts. Nonetheless, if a specific question was raised about conflicts of interest, users can still exercise their rights through channels like user data requests (Section marked \"* **User data requests**\")."

        "Answer": "Based on the summary provided, it appears that the Privacy Policy Document does not explicitly mention addressing potential conflicts of interest in data usage or sharing.\n\nHowever, I can note that users have control over their data through various options such as opting-in/out to share contact details with merchants, controlling device permissions, and making marketing choices (Section marked \"* **Data sharing**\" and \"* **Marketing and advertising choices**\"). This suggests that Uber prioritizes user consent in handling their data.\n\nIf I had to make an educated guess, I'd say that the lack of mention on conflicts of interest is because Uber's approach focuses more on giving users control over their own data rather than explicitly addressing potential conflicts. Nonetheless, if a specific question was raised about conflicts of interest, users can still exercise their rights through channels like user data requests (Section marked \"* **User data requests**\")."

This suggests that Uber prioritizes user consent in handling their data.\n\nIf I had to make an educated guess, I'd say that the lack of mention on conflicts of interest is because Uber's approach focuses more on giving users control over their own data rather than explicitly addressing potential conflicts.

This aligns with principles found in applicable privacy laws and regulations, such as GDPR and CCPA.\n\nAdditionally, the policy provides users with various features to manage their personal data, including **requesting data portability** and **editing account information**, which demonstrates a commitment to user control and transparency (User Data Requests point).\n\nFurthermore, the policy acknowledges device owners' **permission settings for accessing certain types of device data** (Device permissions point), showing consideration for users' rights over their own device data.\n\nOverall, these aspects suggest that Uber's Privacy Notice is indeed compliant with applicable privacy laws and regulations. **Reference: Overall statement**, which emphasizes transparency and user control."
