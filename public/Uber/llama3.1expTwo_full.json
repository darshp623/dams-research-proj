However, this typically applies when personal data is no longer necessary for the original purpose it was collected.\n3. **Platform-specific policies**: Some platforms, like Google or Facebook, have policies regarding account closure and deletion of associated data. You might need to check their help centers or contact support directly.\n4. **General expectation of privacy**: While not a formal right, many people expect their personal information to be kept private. However, this is more of an informal expectation rather than a legally enforceable right.\n\nTo clarify your specific situation, could you please provide me with more details?
