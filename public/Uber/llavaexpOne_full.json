However, the platform takes steps to protect individual privacy by anonymizing or aggregating user data in certain ways.\n\nFirstly, users' names and personal information are not visible to other users. Instead, users are identified by a unique identifier. This means that users cannot see each other's real names, contact information, or any other personally identifiable information (PII). Additionally, Uber has strict policies in place to prevent the misuse of data, including the collection and sharing of PII without proper authorization.\n\nSecondly, ratings are aggregated so that individual users cannot be identified. The platform takes steps to ensure that users' identities remain anonymous, and only the average rating is displayed to other users. This means that users cannot see the specific ratings given by others or identify who those ratings were from.\n\nOverall, Uber takes privacy very seriously, and has implemented a number of measures to protect users' data, including anonymizing and aggregating user data in certain ways.
