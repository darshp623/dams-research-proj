Subprocessors are individuals or entities that a data processor engages with to assist in processing personal data.\n\nTo ensure that data processors and subprocessors adhere to privacy requirements, controllers should:\n\n1. Conduct due diligence before engaging with a data processor or subprocessor. This includes reviewing their privacy policies and practices, as well as any relevant certifications or accreditations they may have.\n2. Enter into written agreements with data processors and subprocessors that outline their respective obligations under applicable privacy laws and regulations. These agreements should include provisions related to data security, data retention, and data breach notification requirements.\n3. Monitor and audit data processors and subprocessors periodically to ensure they are complying with their contractual obligations and privacy requirements. This may involve reviewing their internal policies and procedures, conducting site visits, or engaging third-party auditors to perform independent assessments.\n4. Implement data protection impact assessments (DPIAs) when processing personal data that is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals. DPIAs are used to identify and mitigate potential privacy risks before processing takes place.\n5.
